This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of The DICT
Development Group's (www.dict.org) dictd distribution, containing
client/server software implementing the Dictionary Server Protocol,
as described in RFC 2229.

The programs that make up the dictd distribution were written by
Rickard E. Faith (faith@acm.org).

This package was constructed by Kirk Hilliard <kirk@debian.org> from
sources obtained from http://sf.net/projects/dict, and was based on
the original Debian dict packages built and maintained until June 2004
by Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>.
