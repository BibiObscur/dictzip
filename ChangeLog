dictd (1.10.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  (closes: #339792)
    See /usr/share/doc/dictd/NEWS for a summary of changes in this version.
    Most significantly, dictd now uses internal implementations of
    UCS-2/UTF-8 functions.  Thus, dictd no longer need to specify a utf-8
    locale with the --locale option in order to use dictionaries encoded
    in utf-8.  (closes: #232227, #314325, #292068, #297616)
    Upstream release also fixes a typo for the dict(1) man page.
    (closes: #310349, #336049)
  * Fixed typo in package description.  (closes: #311138)
  * Pached libmaa/log.c to prevent logging buffer overflow.
  * The pid file is back, so changed /etc/init.d/dictd accordingly.
    Note that dictd still drops root privileges in favor of dictd.dictd
    immediately after writing the pid file.

 -- Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Mar 2004 10:08:02 -0500


dictd (1.9.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Roland.  Closes: #231545

    conversion of dict-de-en to utf-8 encoding.

 -- Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>  Wed, 04 Feb 2004 16:35:46 -0500


dictd (1.9.11-3) unstable; urgency=low

dictd (1.9.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  See /usr/share/doc/dictd/NEWS for a summary of
    major changes in this version.

  * Upstream now provides a NEWS file.  The changelog was inadvertenmtly
    omitted from the distributed package.  Added symlink from NEWS.gz to
    changelog.gz as a temporary correction.

  * Moved dict.conf from /etc/ to /etc/dictd/.  This permits using
    ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc/dictd instead of patching defs.h.

  * The dictd binary package no longer includes the plug-in shared
    libraries (dictdplugin_exit.so and dictdplugin_popen.so) in
    /usr/lib/dictd, and the man_popen files (man_popen.dict,
    man_popen.index, and search_man) in /usr/share/dictd/examples.
    /usr/share/doc/dictd/README.Plugins.gz has been modified to reflect
    this change.

  * If dictd fails due to incompatiability of a database locale with
    dictd's locale, it is now logged.  Closes: #216981

  * Edited dictfmt.1 to clarify what goes into the 00-database-info and
    what is considered the first headword.  Closes: #209055

  * dictfmt is broken in 1.9.11.  Inserted dictfmt.c, libmaa/string.c and
    libmaa/maa.h from CVS (Mon, 06 Jan 2004) into source tree, and patched
    dictfmt.c to fix some formatting problems.

 -- Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>  Mon, 05 Jan 2004 14:06:28 -0500


dictd (1.9.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /usr/share/doc/README.Dictd-locales.gz to clarify the use of the
    --locale option.  Closes: #213745

  * Added /usr/share/doc/NEWS.Debian.gz

  * Applied patch from Grant Hollingworth <grant@antiflux.org> to
    dictfmt.c.  This patch eliminates indentation errors in the first
    headword of a .dict file. This makes `dict -i-' and `dict
    00-database-info' work correctly.  Thanks, Grant. Closes: #221184

  * Added "Usage:" line to help screens for dict, dictd, and dictfmt.
    Closes: #221945


 -- Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Dec 2003 20:28:30 -0500


dictd (1.9.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * quoted "$PAGER" in test in dictl Closes: #204284.

  * Applied patch by Kirk Hilliard to clientparse.y to accept the keyword
    pager (/usr/bin/pager) as the name of the pager in dict.conf.
    Closes: #204375

  * Modified manpage dictd.8 to clarify the necessity of dictd's --locale
    setting matching the databases in the configuration file.

  * Modified manpage dict.1 to mention the default pager used.

 -- Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Aug 2003 18:37:12 -0400


dictd (1.9.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  Major changes include:
    Added -t option to dictfmt.
    The predefined DICT servers dict.org and alt0.dict.org are disabled in
    dict by default.
    Implemented 'filter' option to dictd.
    Added several configure variables to specify specific LD_FLAGS for
    particular executables.  (Not meaningful for users of Debian binary
    packages.)

  * When purging dictd, postrm now uses rmdir --ignore-fail-on-non-empty
    instead of rm -fr to remove configuration directories.

  * Patched defs.h to use /etc/dictd/ for dictd.conf

  * Added a conffile, /etc/default/dictd, containing startup options for
    dictd.  This will make it easier to specify command line options, such
    as the locale to be used by dictd, and logging options.
    Closes: #109461, #198402, #174696

  * Added note specifying Debian location of dictd.conf under "FILES" in
    dictd.8. Closes: #202951

  * Included a script, /usr/bin/dictl, as a wrapper for dict.  This script
    converts characters encoded in utf-8 to the user's preferred character
    set. Closes: #147482

  * Deleted statement in dictd.8, under "BUGS", that says there is no way
    to get a running server to re-read the configuration file.  (This
    should have been done in 1.9.3-1.)

 -- Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>  Mon, 04 Aug 2003 15:53:01 -0400


dictd (1.9.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added #include <assert.h> in dictdplugin_popen.cpp Closes: # 195405

 -- Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>  Fri, 30 May 2003 16:37:07 -0400


dictd (1.9.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected references to configuration file in README.Debian and in
    dictd.8

  * Changed dictd.8 to mention that a SIGHUP makes dictd re-read the
    confioguration file.

 -- Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>  Fri, 16 May 2003 18:26:18 -0400


dictd (1.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (1.9.8 was not packaged).  Major changes since
    1.9.7 include:

    debian inetd patch has been included by upstream.
    dictd may now be compiled and run on Cygwin.
    dict is patched to prevent segfaulting on abnormally long command
    lines.  Closes: #166336

  * dictdconfig now recognizes *.sufix and *.word index files and creates
    appropriate configuration entries.

  * Added `-D_REENTRANT' to CFLAGS for plugin libraries.

  # The definition of DICTD_CONFIG_NAME has moved from dictd.h to defs.h,
    so patch for config files in /etc/dictd/ ha also moved to defs.h

 -- Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 2003 15:41:40 -0400


dictd (1.9.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * use -fPIC for plugin libraries Closes: #185092

 -- Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Mar 2003 09:57:50 -0500


dictd (1.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  (1.9.5, 1.9.6 and 1.9.7 were released too
    quickly for me to package 1.9.5 and 1.9.6)  Major changes since 1.9.3
    include:

    Added --add-strategy option
    Added ability to define plugins in the configuration file.
    Added ability to define virtual dictionaries in the configuration file.
    Added keyword 'invisible' for the databse specification of the
    configuration file.
    Various bugfixes and code cleanups.

  * Plugin libraries and sample plugin man_popen are compiled and included
    in the dictd package as examples.

  * Removed emacs variables from changelog.

  * Use `./configure  --verbose --prefix=$(PREFIX) --libexecdir=/usr/lib/dictd
     --datadir=/usr/share/dictd --sysconfdir=/etc' in
    rules instead of tweaking Makefile.in

  * changelog for 1.9.3-1 failed to mention that changing the location
    of dictd configuration files required patching dictd.h (since the
    configuration directory is in CFLAGS, and all executables use the same
    CFLAGS).

  * New upstream version.  Major changes in this version include:

    Virtual dictionaries support; script to create them provided
    New search strategy 'word'
    Configuration file reloading by SIGHUP
    A lot of plugin enhancements and two plugin examples.

    the above fix to #165787.

  * Pached Makefile.in to fix configuration and installation directories

  * Modified init file to use SIGHUP for restart.

    dictd uses the system libz (the Debian package has done this since
    1.5.5-10).

  * Updated dictd and dictfmt manpages to reflect new options, and correct
    the most egregious errors and omissions of the original dictfmt manpage.

    errors that prevent startup (and were previously silent).
    Closes: #137500

    Improved reporting of authentication matching and access denial.

    Fixed dictunzip problem with single chunk files.

    non C collating order should work.

    Make sure pager is closed when reporting fatal error.
    Closes: #141846

  *  Modified Makefile.in and libmaa/Makefile.in to not remove configure
    on distclean and to honor DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.

  *  Applied inetd patch.

  *  Modified rules file to make a separate dictzip package.  To avoid
    transition problems, dictd depends on dictzip.  This dependency may be
    removed when woody+1 is released.
    Closes: #141190

  *  Added dependencies on netbase and adduser.
    Closes: #147784

  * Removed --html option from dict.c help message
    closes: #113479

  * Made numerous corrections and clarifications to dictd.8, including

    syslog logging facility dictd should use.

    version.

 -- Robert D. Hilliard <hilliard@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Jan 2001 13:28:43 -0500

dictd (1.4.9-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Rlease Manager: This should be safe for frozen since it only adds a
    sleep command in /etc/init.d/dictd restart and uogrades the control
    file for the latest versoinp of the policy manual.

  * Restart is implemented in /etcinit.d/dictd restart by stopping and
    restarting the daemon.  It is possible for the start command to be
    issued before the daemon is stopped, in which case the daemon is not
    started.

    Added a pause between stopping and restarting the daemon.

  * Patched dictd.c with patch from Kirk Hilliard <kirk@ghoti.com) to
    cause dictd to drop root privileges as soon as it starts, and to

    permits eliminating `su nobody' from the init.d script.

    dictd control

dictd (1.4.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release

  * Corrected name of dictd configuration file in two places in the
    manpage dictd.8

  * Removed configure from the files removed by the distclean target in
    Makefile.in in top level and libmaa directories so autoconf will not
    be required to run configure after making distclean.

  * Added doc/Makefile to rm -f line in top level Makefile.in distclean.
    doc is excluded from $subdirs, so it isn't built or cleaned, but
    configure makes Makefile.
